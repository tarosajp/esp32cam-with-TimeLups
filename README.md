# esp32cam-with-TimeLups
I made a time lapse using esp32cam.The save method is SD card. Low cost and seaving power.

You can shoot up to 255 x 999 images using "EPROM ()"function.
Even if you reset it, the number will be recorded in Rom(EPROM), so it will not be overwritten.

If you want to change the time, change 180 (3 minutes) on line 101.
This unit of number is seconds.
